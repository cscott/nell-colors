add explicit metrics for Delius font so that letters match up optimally.
x brush selection
image thumbnails on gallery page
delete picture option on gallery page
x paintbrush dialog (replace range sliders)
layers menu
 - select background (camera api)
include a decent # of samples: cat / bat / mat / cab / lion at least!
x new toolbar order: undo/redo/movie     color/brush/swatches    layers/save
replace 'play' icon with movie camera
four states, "can't play", "can play", "playing", "stopping"
x swap brush and color pane in dialog
set undo/redo buttons active appropriately
'pressed' highlight for touch
more margin spacing between buttons if toolbar is wide
update firefox? slowness, crashes =(
don't try to recognize letters if aspect ratio is way off or stroke is too long
still not reliably snapshotting tail end of command list; first 'undo' should
 always be fast
x hook up funf
x funf startup
x funf letters recognized (and prob)
- funf thumbnails at close
- funf pause/resume events

eyedropper tool.
lasso tool

x brush rotation:
 x constant increment
 x path following
x reset spacing to default brush spacing when brush is changed

x convert audio to webm
x rename manifests
x add .nojekyll
x fix touch events on dialog sliders
x fix touch events on dialog color wheel (and keyboard focus?)
x fix keyboard focus on brush selector?
x make focused +/-/up buttons prettier
x resize elements instead of using css transform, since transform screws up
   event location parsing.  shrink to ~320px wide and/or use percentages.
x fix slider to allow click and drag off the handle.
x rewrite color wheel to be faster -- opacity on white/black circles perhaps?
----
x double buffer to implement transparency mechanism.
x tool bar at top
x undo/redo
x replay
x refactor into a 'drawing' class
x recognize letters:
 x draw box over bb
 x draw letter over bb
 - animation
   (maybe animate by playing an ncolors document?
    open up new layer, draw on that.
    allow dragging layers to new positions, this might help "run".
    microphone button, record audio snippets that play at the
    appropriate times during the replay)
    audio snippets ought to have text as well.  use HMM recognizer
    to segment speech, highlight appropriate words.

x dump drawings to local storage
  - sync w/ google app engine
select backgrounds: letter/primer pictures (camera)
implement gallery (preload with letter images)
lasso strokes and then drag them around -- simple animation
  plays well with layers -- draw background, then draw foreground and drag it
  around
play back audio tagged with word positions.
two pane ui -- text interaction on right?

--
x implement arbitrary brush images (128x128)
implement color wheel chooser
implement image rotation along path
implement variable brush spacing, brush size
implement layers (then draggable layers?)
implement audio snippets
zoom canvas, two finger scroll to drag zoomed version
implement color picker (eyedropper)

--
audit layers code, ensure that we are snapping drawImage to integer pixel
locations and that we quantize appropriately when determining spacing (ie,
don't draw multiple times in the same location quantized location).

Scaling: keep layers code pixel accurate (for above), scale points in higher
layers. 

Min/max of drawing (aspect ratio) is always fixed to that of original device
when it was created.  Resolution, too? (If variable resolution, then we should probably keep brush size constant even when zooming in/out.)

Thumbnails (based on original size?) 120x160 (doubled on iphone?)

Label size/opacity sliders.

Offline web font
Appcache
-----
fix new performance regression on ios w/ lowercase =(

use "overlapping bounding boxes" as the metric for grouping segments, not time

add offline features to recognizer

audio sprites
------
