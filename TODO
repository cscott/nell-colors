x double buffer to implement transparency mechanism.
x tool bar at top
x undo/redo
replay
refactor into a 'drawing' class
recognize letters:
 - draw box over bb
 - draw letter over bb
 - animation
   (maybe animate by playing an ncolors document?
    open up new layer, draw on that.
    allow dragging layers to new positions, this might help "run".
    microphone button, record audio snippets that play at the
    appropriate times during the replay)
    audio snippets ought to have text as well.  use HMM recognizer
    to segment speech, highlight appropriate words.

dump drawings to local storage
  - sync w/ google app engine
select backgrounds: letter/primer pictures
implement gallery (preload with letter images)
lasso strokes and then drag them around -- simple animation
  plays well with layers -- draw background, then draw foreground and drag it
  around
play back audio tagged with word positions.
two pane ui -- text interaction on right?

--
implement arbitrary brush images (128x128)
implement color wheel chooser
implement image rotation along path
implement variable brush spacing, brush size
implement layers (then draggable layers?)

zoom canvas, two finger scroll to drag zoomed version
implement color picker
